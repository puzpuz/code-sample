I always split my code into several folders
- activities: folders for all android app pages (called Activites)
- adapters: folders for all data adapters for each list view, or grid view in the apps (mostly custom adapter)
- asynchronous: is a folders for all code interfacing the API, to get, or send data to the web service
- datasource: is a folder to manage the database inside the app (either fixed data storage, or just cache)
- dialogs: folder to store all codes related to custom dialogs that I created
- fragments: to store Android Fragments (one layer above Activities)
- models: to store a class for each data that I get from the web service (so for each record, I only need to create new object from this class)
- receivers & services: to store broadcast receiver and background service (if necessary)
- utils: all utility code like date formater etc
- widgets: to store custom widgets either from other source, or self made


AttributeSearchActivity.java

- This activity linked to:
	AttributeDataSource to get the data from the database
	AttributeSearchAdapter to manage custom list of the data
	AttributesItem as an object for each attribute (represented on an Array List for a list of attribute data)
- AsyncAttr is a code to get attribute data from webservice.
